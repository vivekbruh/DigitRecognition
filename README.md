# DigitRecognition
Extremely basic neural network model to recognize digits inputted in a 28x28 format

If you want to test out this code on your own, make a folder in your project file called digits, and create your own digit pngs in the 28x28 format and input them. 
Note: Data training set is pretty limited, so your results will mainly be based on how closely you imitate the mnist data set images in your own images.
